					Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. If anything in this life is certain,
					if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone.
					Friends and money - oil and water. It's not personal. It's business. I
					don't trust a doctor who can hardly speak English. Is that why you
					slapped my brother around in public? Your enemies always get strong on
					what you leave behind. Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that
					you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter.
					And may their first child be a masculine child. When they come... they
					come at what you love. My father taught me many things here - he
					taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but
					your enemies closer. I don't like violence, Tom. I'm a businessman;
					blood is a big expense. Only don't tell me you're innocent. Because it
					insults my intelligence and makes me very angry. Why did you go to the
					police? Why didn't you come to me first? Hey, listen, I want somebody
					good - and I mean very good - to plant that gun. I don't want my
					brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hands,
					alright? I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my
					enemies. Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've always been loyal to you.
					I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse. That's my family Kay,
					that's not me. Don't ever give an order like that again. Not while I'm
					alive. What's the matter with you, huh? What am I going to do? Am I
					going to make that baby an orphan before he's born? What's the matter
					with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries
					like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense?
					Ridiculous! Mr Corleone is Johnny Fontane's godfather. Now Italians
					regard that as a very close, a very sacred religious relationship.
					Michael, you never told me you knew Johnny Fontane! You talk about
					vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy
					to me? My father's name was Antonio Andolini... and this is for you.
					The hotel, the casino. The Corleone Family wants to buy you out. Te
					salut, Don Corleone. I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You
					broke my heart! Fredo, you're my older brother, and I love you. But
					don't ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever.
					Sonny, please don't do anything. Please don't do anything. I have a
					sentimental weakness for my children and I spoil them, as you can see.
					They talk when they should listen. I want your answer and the money by
					noon tomorrow. And one more thing. Don't you contact me again, ever.
					From now on, you deal with Turnbull. Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.
